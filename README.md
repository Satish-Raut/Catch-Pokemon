## API Reference
- [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Notes & Learning Points

- **Promise.all**: Used to fetch multiple PokÃ©mon in parallel. Resolves when all fetches complete, rejects if any fail.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes CSS Grid and media queries to ensure cards look good on all devices.
- **Component Structure**: Each PokÃ©mon card is a reusable component (`PokemonCards`).
- **Destructuring & Optional Chaining**: Used for safe access to deeply nested API data.
- **Array Methods**: `.map()`, `.join()`, `.slice()` are used for rendering lists and formatting data.
- **Modern CSS**: Uses Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties for layout and style.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle API errors gracefully in production apps.
